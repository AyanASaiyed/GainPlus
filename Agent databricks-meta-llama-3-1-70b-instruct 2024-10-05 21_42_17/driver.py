# Databricks notebook source
# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC # Driver notebook
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This is an auto-generated notebook created by an AI Playground export. We generated three notebooks in the same folder:
# MAGIC - [agent]($./agent): contains the code to build the agent.
# MAGIC - [config.yml]($./config.yml): contains the configurations.
# MAGIC - [**driver**]($./driver): logs, evaluate, registers, and deploys the agent.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This notebook uses Mosaic AI Agent Framework ([AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/en/generative-ai/retrieval-augmented-generation.html) | [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/generative-ai/retrieval-augmented-generation)) to deploy the agent defined in the [agent]($./agent) notebook. The notebook does the following:
# MAGIC 1. Logs the agent to MLflow
# MAGIC 2. Evaluate the agent with Agent Evaluation
# MAGIC 3. Registers the agent to Unity Catalog
# MAGIC 4. Deploys the agent to a Model Serving endpoint
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Prerequisities
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Address all `TODO`s in this notebook.
# MAGIC - Review the contents of [config.yml]($./config.yml) as it defines the tools available to your agent, the LLM endpoint, and the agent prompt.
# MAGIC - Review and run the [agent]($./agent) notebook in this folder to view the agent's code, iterate on the code, and test outputs.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Next steps
# MAGIC
# MAGIC After your agent is deployed, you can chat with it in AI playground to perform additional checks, share it with SMEs in your organization for feedback, or embed it in a production application. See docs ([AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/en/generative-ai/deploy-agent.html) | [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/generative-ai/deploy-agent)) for details

# MAGIC ## Evaluate the agent with [Agent Evaluation](https://docs.databricks.com/generative-ai/agent-evaluation/index.html)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC You can edit the requests or expected responses in your evaluation dataset and run evaluation as you iterate your agent, leveraging mlflow to track the computed quality metrics.

Your body shape is characterized by a relatively straight up and down silhouette, with a similar measurement around your bust, waist, and hips.\n\n**Desired Physique:**\nThe analysis suggests that your desired physique is that of a mesomorph body type with an hourglass body shape.

Your body shape is characterized by a relatively straight up and down silhouette, with a similar measurement around your bust, waist, and hips.\n\n**Desired Physique:**\nThe analysis suggests that your desired physique is that of a mesomorph body type with an hourglass body shape. This means you're aiming for a more curvy and toned physique, with a smaller waist and a more pronounced bust and hips. Your desired body shape is characterized by a more feminine and athletic silhouette, with a narrower waist and a more defined muscle mass.\n\nNow that I have a better understanding of your current and desired physique, I'd like to ask some questions to create a personalized workout and meal plan for you.\n\nHere's my first question:\n\nWhat is your current activity level?

This means you have a relatively balanced muscle mass and body fat distribution, with a tendency to store fat around your midsection. Your body shape is characterized by a relatively straight up and down silhouette, with a similar measurement around your bust, waist, and hips.\n\n**Desired Physique:**\nThe analysis suggests that your desired physique is that of a mesomorph body type with an hourglass body shape. This means you're aiming for a more curvy and toned physique, with a smaller waist and a more pronounced bust and hips. Your desired body shape is characterized by a more feminine and athletic silhouette, with a narrower waist and a more defined muscle mass.\n\nNow that I have a better understanding of your current and desired physique, I'd like to ask some questions to create a personalized workout and meal plan for you.\n\nHere's my first question:\n\nWhat is your current activity level? Do you have any experience with working out, or are you just starting out?"

For example, do you focus on cardio, weightlifting, or a mix of both?"

This might give me some insight into your preferences and goals.\n\nHere's my next question:\n\nAre you looking to focus on a specific area of your body, such as your core, legs, or upper body, or do you want a more general full-body workout plan? You can also say \"focus\" before a specific area if you want to target it more intensely."

However, since you want to focus on your lower body, I might include some strength training exercises to help you build muscle and tone your legs.\n\nHere's my next question:\n\nWhat are your goals for your lower body? Are you looking to lose weight, build muscle, or increase your overall strength and endurance? Additionally, do you have a specific weight loss goal in mind, or a certain body fat percentage you're aiming for?"

Are there any foods or food groups that you particularly enjoy or dislike?\n\n(This will help me create a personalized meal plan that suits your needs and preferences)\n\nAlso, just to let you know, this is my last question before I generate your workout and meal plan!"
